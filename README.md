In this project I was ready to build my first website, I was having some problems trying to understand the necessary tools for web development, but I decided to take the easiest path, and learnt along the way, I will learn how to set up my documents for a web site, use Chrome's Devtools, and write basic HTML and CSS elements in Visual Code (Text Editor).
